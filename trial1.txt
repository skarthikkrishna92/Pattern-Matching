No matter how you slice it, LinkedIn is a pricey stock. But that doesn't mean it can't be worth the premium. In fact, LinkedIn is worth every penny. Here's why. Of all the social networks, LinkedIn easily has the best business with the strongest monetization strategy. Yet, it's actually the cheapest of the three major players by some valuation metrics like price-to-sales. One partial explanation for this discount is that LinkedIn's top line is growing at a slightly slower pace. Naturally, LinkedIn relies heavily on network effects. But in this case, LinkedIn's business benefits in 2 ways as its base of registered members (currently over 313 million) continues to grow. The value proposition that LinkedIn offers to both members and corporate solutions customers strengthens as the member base grows. As the professional networker has grown its member base by more than fourfold over the past four years, the number of corporate solutions customers has increased by 14-fold to over 28,000. Users of ad-based social networks generally don't like when their data is being sold to advertisers. Users of LinkedIn generally don't mind when their data is being sold to possible recruiters that might make them a job offer. In effect, LinkedIn gets to play both sides of the job market as the ongoing social networking revolution rages on. That's just one of several important differentiators that LinkedIn enjoys relative to its ad-based peers. Another important distinction is that LinkedIn has immense growth opportunities in China, just recently launching a localized version of its site in Simplified Chinese. Meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter remain blocked in the Middle Kingdom. The company had approximately 4 million members in China in February, and hopes to grow that figure to over 140 million in the coming years. Judging by how member growth has translated into revenue growth up until now, there's a lot to be bullish on if LinkedIn can approach its full potential in China. The good news is that LinkedIn's salesforce is very effective (remember the aforementioned outsized increase in corporate solutions customers?), and is largely responsible for driving recent revenue gains. Scalability implications aside, that's money well spent. The net result is that LinkedIn's business over the long-term will be quite scalable, like most Internet services, especially once its data center buildout is complete.
