Home-improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE: HD  ) has made a huge impression on the stock market in recent years, with explosive share price gains having contributed greatly to the record run that sent the S&P 500 above the 2,000 mark for the first time earlier this week. Yet even though Home Depot earnings have looked healthy and prospects appear strong for the company's future, there are still some dangers that the retailer will have to overcome to keep moving forward. CEO Frank Blake's imminent departure could cause some transition issues for shareholders. Current CEO Frank Blake assumed the head role at Home Depot in 2007, following the controversial realm of former CEO Bob Nardelli. Blake just announced that he will give up the CEO role as of Nov. 1, giving way to current U.S. retail president Craig Menear. With 34 years of experience in retail, Menear is a perfectly capable executive, and no one seems disappointed with the company's selection of Menear as Blake's successor. But the uncertainty involved with any CEO succession plan will put Menear under pressure in his first few quarters, and after such a successful time with Blake, Home Depot will have to keep firing on all cylinders to satisfy the high expectations of its investors. Home Depot won't necessarily be able to repeat its past success in weathering tough macroeconomic environments. Home Depot could have trouble expanding to international markets. With Home Depot firing on all cylinders, betting against the stock has been a bad move lately. Yet with these challenges still ahead of it, Home Depot could easily see its shares give up some ground even if its long-term strategy appears sound.
